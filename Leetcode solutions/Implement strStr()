Implement strStr().
Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
Output: 0

Solution:
#define ll long long int
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        ll len1=haystack.size();
        ll len2=needle.size();
        if(len2>len1) return -1;
        ll ans=-1;
        for(ll i=0;i<=len1-len2;i++)
        {
            string sub=haystack.substr(i,len2);
            if(sub==needle)
            {
                ans=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
